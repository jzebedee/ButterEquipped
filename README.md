Butter Equipped is an equipment manager for Mount & Blade II: Bannerlord.

## How it works

### Equipping

Simply go to the Inventory screen and click the green "Equip" button.

Butter Equipped automatically compares and upgrades equipment in your inventory, selecting the best option for each slot of equipment.

Butter Equipped can also upgrade your entire party, saving time on equipping each companion individually.

### Lock inventory slots

Toggle the lock next to individual slots in the inventory screen to prevent Butter Equipped from changing them.

### Auto-Equip

Turn on Auto-Equip in the MCM Settings menu to make Butter Equipped run every time you close the inventory screen. No more sorting through loot windows for the best equipment!
